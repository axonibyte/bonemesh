# BoneMesh #

**BoneMesh** is an implementation of an abstract point-to-point mesh network in Java.

Version 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. Requires Java 11. We are still working on documentation!

This version will incorporate dynamic routes. Right now this network is point-to-point. We're going to eliminate the need for every node to have n-1 connections to be fully accessible.
